# Introduction
My Vim plugins and settings, intended for people who use Vim for proramming and editing. It includes:
- *Desert* color scheme. This scheme works best with terminal console such as PuTTY, which I frequently use.
- Plugins:
	- EnhancedCommentify
	- taglist
	- vimExplorer
- Uncommon syntax:
	- Pawn. This is a language I used to work with a lot.

And there're various settings I put in the vimrc file, which I found necessary.
